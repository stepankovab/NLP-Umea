We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno, 

but It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready
And there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin
Thunder
You telling this story or am I?
I'm sorry mi vida, go on
Bruno says, "It looks like rain"
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day
 but anyway

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno

Hey, grew to live in fear of Bruno 
stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, 
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
#Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
#Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?

A seven-foot frame, 
rats along his back
When he calls your name it all fades to black
Yeah he sees your dreams 
and feasts on your screams

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno

He told me my fish would die, the next day dead 
He told me I'd grow a gut and just like he said 
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head 
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine 
(Ã“ye, Mariano's on his way)
He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him, now
Hey sis, I want not a sound out of you
It's like I can hear him now, I can hear him now

Um Bruno
Yeah about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Gimme the truth and the whole truth Bruno 
(Isabela, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner
(And I'm fine, and I'm fine, and I'm fine, I'm fine)
He's here
Don't talk about Bruno, no
Why did I talk about Bruno?
Not a word about Bruno
I never shoulda brought up Bruno
