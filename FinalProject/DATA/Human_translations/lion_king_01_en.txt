I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared.
For what?

For the death of the king.

Why, is he sick?

No, fools. We'll kill him. And Simba too!

Great idea! Who needs a king? No king, no king, la la la la la la.

Idiots! There will be a king!

But you said...

I will be king. Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

Yay! All right!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point htat I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me

So prepare for the coup of the centrury
Be prepared for the murkiest scam (Oooh!)
Meticulous planning (We'll have food!)
Tenacity spanning (Lots of food)
Decades of denial (We repeat)
Is simply why I'll (Endless meat)
Be king undisputed (Aaaaaaah!)
Respected, saluted (Aaaaaaah!)
And seen for the wonder I am (Aaaaaaah!)

Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!

Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
