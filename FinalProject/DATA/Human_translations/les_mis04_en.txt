Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed


You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

I know it, Papa

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
(Oh, I'm ready, Fantine.)
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy


Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God


Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
We will walk behind the ploughshare;
We will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that we bring
When tomorrow comes!
