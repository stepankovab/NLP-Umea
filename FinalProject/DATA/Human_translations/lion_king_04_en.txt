Chimps are going ape, giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg but I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be coming back for lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

What are you doing, son?

Pouncing.

Let an old pro show you how it's done.

The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grass		Stay low to the ground
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink and		Yeah, okay, stay low to the ground, right!
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herds			Shh, not a sound
Moving down the rank and file		Take it slow
To near the bottom rung			One more step
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dung		Then â€”
Awk!

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
