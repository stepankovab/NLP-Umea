What would I give to live where you are
What would I pay to stay here beside you
What would I do to see you, smiling at me
Where would we walk
Where would we run
If we could stay all day in the sun
Just you and me
And I could be..
Part of your world


I don't know when
I don't know how
But I know something's starting right now
Watch and you'll see
Someday I'll be
Part of your world.
