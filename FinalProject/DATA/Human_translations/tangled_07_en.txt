This is why you never should have left
Dear, this whole romance that you've invented
Just proves you're too naive to be here
Why would he like you? Come on now - really!
Look at you - you think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy
Come with mummy
Mother - 

No!
No?! Oh. I see how it is.

Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now
Such a clever grown-up miss
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now
Go ahead, then give him this

This is why he's here!
Don't let him deceive you!
Give it to him, watch, you'll see!

Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you
I won't say I told you so - no
Rapunzel knows best!
So if he's such a dreamboat
Go and put him to the test

If he's lying
Don't come crying
Mother knows best...
