I'm malicious mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
But despite my evil look
And my temper and my hook
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart?
Tickling the ivories 'til they gleam?
Yep I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley
Thank you!

'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream
He's got a dream!
He's got a dream!

See I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem!
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers
Like everybody else
I've got a dream!

I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes
And let's not even mention my complexion
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter, and my nose
I really want to make a love connection
Can't you see me with a special little lady
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter --

'Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream
I've got a dream!
He's got a dream!
I've got a dream!
He's got a dream!

And I know one day romance will reign supreme!
Though my face leaves people screaming
There's a child behind it dreaming --
Like everybody else I've got a dream

Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime
Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

I have dreams like you - no, really!
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!
I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!

I just want to see The floating lanterns gleam!
And with every passing hour
I'm so glad I left my tower -

Like all you lovely folks I've got a dream!
She's got a dream!
He's got a dream!
They've got a dream!
We've got a dream!

So our diff 'rences ain't
really that extreme!
We're one big team...!
Call us brutal Sick Sadistic
And grotesquely optimistic

Cause way down deep inside We've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!
I've got a dream!

Yes way down deep
inside, I've got a dream!
Yeahh!
