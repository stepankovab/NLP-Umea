I just made something unexpected
Something sharp
Something new
It's not symmetrical or perfect
But it's beautiful
And it's mine
What else can I do?
Bring it in, bring it in
(Good talk!) Bring it in, bring it in
What else can I do?
(Let's walk!) Bring it in, bring it in
(Free hugs!) Bring it in, bring it in
I grow rows and rows of roses
Flor de mayo
By the mile
I make perfect, practiced poses
So much hides behind my smile
What could I do 
if I just grew 
what I was feeling in the moment?
(Do you know where you're going Whoa!)

What could I do if I just knew it didn't need to be perfect?
It just needed to be? 
And they let me be A hurricane of jacarandas
Strangling figs Hanging vines 
Palma de cera fills the air as I climb
And I push through

What else can I do?
Can I deliver us a river of sundew?
Careful, it's carnivorous, a little just won't do
I wanna feel the shiver of something new
I'm so sick of pretty
I want something true, don't you?
You just seem like your life's been a dream
Since the moment you opened your eyes
(How far do these roots go down?)
All I know are the blossoms you grow
But it's awesome to see 
how you rise
How far can I rise?
Through the roof, to the skies
Let's go!
A hurricane of jacarandas 
Strangling figs Hanging vines
Palma de cera fills the air as I climb
And I push through
What else, what else?
What can you do when you are deeply madly truly in the moment?
(Seize the moment keep goin')
What can you do when you know who you wanna be isn't perfect?
But I'll still be okay
Hey, everybody clear the way (Whoo!)
I'm coming through with tabebuia
(She's coming through with that booyah!)
Making waves (Making waves)
Changing minds (You've changed mine)
The way is clearer 'cause you're here, and well
I owe this all to you
What else can I do?
Show 'em what you can do
What else can I do?
There's nothing you can't do
What else can I do?
