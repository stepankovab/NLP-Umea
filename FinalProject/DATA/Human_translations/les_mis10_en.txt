There is a castle on a cloud
I like to go there in my sleep
Aren't any floors for me to sweep
Not in my castle on a cloud

There is a lady all in white
Holds me and sings a lullaby
She's nice to see and she's soft to touch
She says, "Cosette, I love you very much."

I know a place where no one's lost
I know a place where no one cries
Crying at all is not allowed
Not in my castle on a cloud
