Seven AM the usual morning lineup
Start on the chores and sweep 'til the floor's all clean
Polish and wax do laundry and mop and shine up
Sweep again and by then it's like seven fifteen

And so I read a book
Or maybe two or three
I'll add a few new paintings
to my gallery
I'll play guitar and knit
And cook and basically
Just wonder when will my life begin?

Then after lunch, it's puzzles and darts and baking
Paper mache a bit of ballet and chess
Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch,
 take a climb Sew a dress!

And I'll reread the books
If I have time to spare
I'll paint the walls some more
I'm sure there's room somewhere
And then I'll brush and brush
And brush and brush my hair
Stuck in the same place I've always been
And I'll keep wondering and wondering
And wondering
When will my life begin?

Tomorrow night
The lights will appear
Just like they do on my birthday each year
What is it like
Out there where they glow?
Now that I'm older
Mother might just
Let me go
