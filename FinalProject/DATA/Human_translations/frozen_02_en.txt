Bees they'll buzz
kids will blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer
A drink in my hand
my snow up against the burning sand
Probably getting gorgeously tanned 
in summer

I'll finally see a summer breeze blow away a winter storm
And find out what happens to solid 
#water when it gets warm
And I can't
wait to see
what my buddies all think of me
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer

The hot and the cold are
both so intense
Put 'em together
it just makes sense
Winter's a good time to
stay in and cuddle
But put me in summer and I'll be a happy snowman

When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream
Of relaxing in the summer sun just lettin' off steam
Oh the sky will be blue
and you guys will be there too
When I finally do
what frozen things do
in summer
In summer
