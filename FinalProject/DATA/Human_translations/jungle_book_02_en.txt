That morning sun peeks over the mountains
And all the rhinos rub their eyes
When they hear
(Hear what?)
Hear the jungle rhythm
Those birds are tap-tap-tappin' the tree trunks
The busy bee hums as he flies
Loud and clear
To the jungle rhythm

Now you can hightail it out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder
(It's moving me)
Sounds a lot like being free
When you feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm

Can't do without rhythm
And when it fills the air
Animals everywhere join in the dance
You'll dance along with 'em
Feel it steal your soul
We'll stomp our paws
Flap our wings
Maybe do one, two crazy things!

Check out those chat-chat-chattering monkeys
Swinging through the banyan trees
Two by two (Two by two)
To the jungle rhythm
Sounds like a wolf pack way in the distance
Singing pretty harmonies
Woo-woo-woo
To the jungle rhythm

Now you can hightail it out of the jungle
But it never leaves your heart
First you feel that beat start bubbling under
Then you hear the tom-toms loud as thunder
(It's moving me)
Sounds a lot like being free
When you feel
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm
Feel the jungle rhythm
