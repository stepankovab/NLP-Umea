Please don't slam the door
You don't have to keep your distance anymore
'Cause for the first time in forever
I finally understand

For the first time in forever
We can fix this hand in hand

We can head down this mountain together
You don't have to live in fear
'Cause for the first time in forever
I will be right here

Please go back home
Your life awaits
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates

You mean well
But leave me be
Yes I'm alone but I'm alone and free
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me
