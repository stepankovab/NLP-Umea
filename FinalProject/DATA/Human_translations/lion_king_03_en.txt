I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

Well I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair

I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

This far, a rather uninspiring thing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

No one saying do this

Now when I said that --

No one saying be there

What I meant was --

No one saying stop that

What you don't realize --

No one saying see here

Now see here!

Free to run around all day

That's definitely out!

Free to do it all my way

I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart-to-heart

Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start

If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king

Everybody look left
Everybody look right
Everywhere you look I'm
Standing in the spotlight

Not yet!

Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait...

To be king!
