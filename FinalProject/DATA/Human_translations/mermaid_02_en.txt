Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove
Treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmo's a-plenty
I've got woozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got 20!

But who cares?
No big deal
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancing
Walking around on those
What do you call 'em? oh, feet!

Flipping your fins you don't get to far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
strolling along down the
What's that word again? street

Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give
If I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay
To spend a day
Warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land
They understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women
Sick of swimming
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it
[What's the word?] burn
When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love
Love to explore the shore up above?

Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
