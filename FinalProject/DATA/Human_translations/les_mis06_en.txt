Drink with me to days gone by
To the life (to the life) that used (that used) to be (to be)
At the shrine of friendship, never say die
Let the wine of friendship never run dry
Here's to you and here's to me

Do I care if I should die
Now she goes across the sea?
Life without Cosette
Means nothing at all
Would you weep, Cosette, if I were to fall?
Would you weep, Cosette, for me?
