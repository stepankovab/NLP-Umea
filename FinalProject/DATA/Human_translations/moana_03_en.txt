 Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful baby
Did your granny say, "Listen to your heart"?
"Be who you are on the inside"?
I need three words to tear her argument apart
Your granny lied
I'd rather be shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec, don't you know?
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters, beginners
Oh and here they come, come, come
To the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm, fish dinners
I just love free food
And you look like seafood 

 Well, well, well
Little Maui's having trouble with his look
You little semi-demi-mini-god
Ouch! What a terrible performance
Get the hook! get it?
You don't swing it like you used to man
Yet I have to give you credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide, I can't
I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You could try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod
To beat a decapod
 (Look it up)
You will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your aching heart
Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
You try to be tough
But your armour's just not hard enough
Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney
Ever seen someone so
Shiny?
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea
Just for me
You'll never be quite as shiny
You wish you were nice and shiny
