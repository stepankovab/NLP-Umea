Moana, make way, make way
Moana it's time you knew
The village of Motonui is all you need
The dancers are practicing
They dance to an ancient song
(Who needs a new song? This old one's all we need)

This tradition is our mission
And Moana there's so much to do
Don't trip on the taro root that's all you need
We share everything we make
We joke and we weave our baskets
The fishermen come back from the sea

I wanna see

Don't walk away
Moana stay on the ground now
Our people will need a chief and there you are

There comes a day
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is where you are

Consider the coconut
The what!
Consider its tree
We use each part of the coconut, that's all we need

We make our nets from the fibers
The water's sweet inside
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

Consider the coconuts
The trunks and the leaves
The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

That's right we stay
We're safe and we're well provided
And when we look to the future
There you are
You'll be okay
In time you'll learn just as I did

You must find happiness right where you are

I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like well there you are

You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana that voice inside is who you are

The village believes in us
The village believes
The island gives us what we need
And no one leaves

So here I'll stay
My home my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow
There we are
I'll lead the way
I'll have my people to guide me
We'll build our future together

Where we are

Cause every path leads you back to

Where you are

You can find happiness right

Where you are
Where you are
