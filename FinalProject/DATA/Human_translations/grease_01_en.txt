Well, this car is automatic
It's systematic
It's hydromatic

It's greased lightnin!
We'll get some overhead lifters and four barrel quads, oh yeah
Keep talking, woah, keep talking

A fuel injection cut off and chrome plated rods, oh yeah
I'll get the money, I'll kill to get the money

With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door
You know that it ain't shit, we'll be gettin' lots of tit, greased lightnin'

Go, greased lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'

We'll get some purple pitched tail lights and thirty inch fins, oh yeah
A palomino dashboard and duel-muffler twins, oh yeah
With new boosters, plates and shocks, I can get off my rocks
You know that I ain't braggin', she's a real pussy wagon, greased lightnin'

Go, greased lightnin', you're burning up the quarter mile
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
Go, greased lightnin', you're coasting through the heat lap trials
(Greased lightnin', go, greased lightnin')
You are supreme, the chicks'll cream, for greased lightnin'
