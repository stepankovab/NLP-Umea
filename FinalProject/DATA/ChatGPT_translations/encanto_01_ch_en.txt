"Don't Start with Bruno"
No
No
No
Don't start with Bruno

When I was supposed to have a wedding
We were supposed to have a wedding
The sky seemed
More azure than ever before
More azure than ever before
Bruno comes here with a strange smile
Then thunder

Who started this story
You or I
Oh, sorry, dear, tell us
Bruno said, "I feel rain."
How could he say that?
I said, "You want to annoy me.
This will be solved with an umbrella.
Suddenly, there was wind too.
It was a great day.
I'm just saying

Don't start with Bruno
No
No
No
Don't start with Bruno

Hey
We were just afraid of Bruno mumbling and whispering
He kept muttering something to himself or whispering
Mysteriously, like when sand is sifted
Who likes him no one dared ask
What he predicted, because it crushed you even more
Nobody believed him that it makes sense somehow
Now it makes sense

He's two meters tall, and there are mice on your back
He knows your name and can take your breath away
When he sends horrifying laughter into your dreams

Don't start with Bruno
No
No
No
Don't start with Bruno

He also gave a prediction for my goldfish
And it frightened me immediately
It told me that my navel should grow, and so it is
It predicted that baldness would await me one day
And I really have it
The one who knows the prophecies seals your fate

He told me that my life of dreams
Will come one day
And with it, a chance
He told me that my power will continue to grow and ripen like poppy

No
Mariano is coming to us now

He told me that my dream husband
Is lost to me
That he should marry someone else
That voice in my head
Still sounds
Come here
You better stand away from the guests
That voice is still with me
It's still with me

That Bruno
Yeah, uncle Bruno
So tell me what you did, Bruno
I want to know the truth about what you did here

Isabel
Your suitor

Let's set the table

I am poppy
I am poppy
I am poppy
I am poppy

He's coming here
Stop it with Bruno
Yeah

Now I know
Who Bruno is

Don't start with Bruno
That mysterious uncle Bruno
