Reindeers are better than people
Sven
don't you think that's true
Yeah people will beat you and curse you and cheat you
Every one of em's bad
except you

But people smell better than reindeers
Sven don't you think I'm right
That's once again true
for all except you
You got me
Let's call it a night
Good night
Don't let the frostbite bite
