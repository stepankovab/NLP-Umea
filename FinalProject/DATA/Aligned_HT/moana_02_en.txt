I know a girl from an island
She stands apart from the crowd She loves the sea and her people
She makes her whole family proud
Sometimes the world seems against you
The journey may leave a scar
But scars can heal and reveal just
Where you are

The people you love will change you
The things you have learned will guide you
And nothing on earth can silence
The quiet voice still inside you
And when that voice starts to whisper
"Moana, you've come so far"
Moana listen, do you know who you are

Who am I

I am a girl who loves my island
And the girl who loves the sea, it calls me
I am the daughter of the village chief
We are descended from voyagers
Who found their way across the world
They call me

I've delivered us to where we are
I have journeyed farther
I am everything I've learned and more
Still it calls me

And the call isn't out there at all
It's inside me
It's like the tide Always falling and rising
I will carry you here in my heart
You'll remind me
That come what may
I know the way
I am Moana
