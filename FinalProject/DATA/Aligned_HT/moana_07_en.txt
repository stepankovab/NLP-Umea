There's a line where the sky
meets the sea and it calls me
But no one knows,
how far it goes
All the time wondering where I need to be is behind me
I'm on my own,
to worlds unknown

Every turn I take,
every trail I track
Is a choice I make,
now I can't turn back
From the great unknown
where I go alone
Where I long to be

See her lie
with the night
in the sea,
she calls me
And yes I know
that I can go

There's a moon
in the sky
and the wind is behind me Soon I'll know
how far I'll go
