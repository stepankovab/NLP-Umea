Again you're gone
off on a different path than mine
I'm left behind
wondering if I should follow
You had to go
and of course it's always fine
I probably could catch up
with you tomorrow
But is this what it feels like to be
growing apart
When did I become the one who's always chasing your heart
Now I turn around and find
I am lost in the woods
North is
south
right is left
when you're gone
I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I don't know what path you are on
I'm lost in the woods

Up till now
the next step was a question of how
I never thought it
was a question of whether
Who am I
if I'm not your guy
Where am I
if we're not together
Forever
Now I know you're my true north
'Cause I am lost in the woods
Up is down
day is night
when you're not there
Oh
you're my only landmark
So I'm lost in the woods
Wondering if you still care
But I'll wait for a sign
(For a sign)
That I'm your path
'Cause you are mine
(You are mine)
Until then
I'm lost in the woods
I'm lost in the woods
I'm lost in the woods
