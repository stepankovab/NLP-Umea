This will all make sense
when I am older
Someday I will see that this makes sense
One day
when I'm old and wise
I'll think back
and realize
That these were all completely
normal events
I'll have all the answers when I'm older
Like why we're in this dark
enchanted wood
I know in a couple years these will seem
like childish fears
And so I know this isn't bad it's good

Excuse me
Growing up means adapting Puzzling out your world
and your place
When I'm more mature
I'll feel comfortably secure
Being watched by something with a creepy creepy face
See that will all make
sense when I am older
So there's no need to be terrified or tense

I'll just dream about a time
When I'm in my aged prime
'Cause when you're older
Absolutely everything makes sense
This is fine
