Let's go

This is our home
We've got every generation
So full of music A rhythm of its own design
This is my family
A perfect constellation
So many stars and everybody gets to shine
Whoa
But let's be clear
Abuela runs this show
Whoa
She led us here so many years ago
Whoa And every year our family blessings grow
Whoa There's just a lot you've simply got to know
so

Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal
We're on our way
Wherе all
the people arе fantastical and magical
I’m part of the Family Madrigal

My tía Pepa
Her mood affects the weather
When she's unhappy
Well the temperature gets weird
My tío Bruno
We don’t talk about Bruno

They say he saw the future
one day he disappeared
Oh
And that's my mom Julieta
here's her deal
Whoa
The truth is
she can heal you with a meal
Whoa
Her recipes are remedies
for real
If you're impressed imagine how I feel
Mom

Welcome to the Family Madrigal
The home of the Family Madrigal
I know it sounds a bit fantastical and magical
But I'm part of the Family Madrigal
Two guys fell in love with Family Madrigal
And now they're part of the Family Madrigal
Tío Félix married Pepa
And my dad married Julieta
That's how Abuela became an Abuela Madrigal
Let's go
let's go

We swear to always
Help those around us
And earn the miracle
That somehow found us
The town keeps growing
The world keeps turning
But work and dedication will keep the miracle burning
And each new generation must keep the miracle burning

Wait who's a sister and who's a cousin
There's so many people
How do you keep them all straight

Okay
okay
okay
okay
So many kids in our house
So let's turn the sound up
You know why
I think it's time for
a grandkid round up
Grandkid round up

Cousin Dolores can hear a pin drop
Camilo shape shifts
Antonio gets his gift today
My older sisters
Isabela and Luisa
One strong one graceful Perfect in every way
Isabela
Grows a flower
the town goes wild
Isabela
She's a perfect golden child
Luisa Luisa
Luisa Luisa
And Luisa's super strong
The beauty and the brawn do no wrong

That's life in the Family Madrigal
Whoa Now you know the Family Madrigal
Whoa Where all the people are fantastical and magical
Whoa That's who we are in the Family Madrigal Adios

Well I
gotta go
the life of the Madrigal
Whoa
But now you all know the Family Madrigal
Whoa
I never meant this to
get autobiographical
Whoa
So just to review the Family Madrigal Let's go

But what about Mirabel
It starts with Abuela
And then Tía Pepa
she handles the weather
But what about Mirabel
My mom Julieta
can make you feel better with just one arepa

But what about Mirabel
My dad Agustín

He's accident-prone but he means well
But what about Mirabel
Hey you said you wanna know what everyone does I got sisters and cousins and—
Mirabel

My primo Camilo won't stop until he makes you smile today
Mirabel
My cousin Dolores can hear this whole chorus a mile away
Mirabel
Look it's Mister Mariano
You can marry my sister if you wanna but
Between you and me
she's kind of a prima donna
Yo I've said too much
and thank you but I really gotta go
Mirabel

Mirabel
And I'm in my family so—
Well…
