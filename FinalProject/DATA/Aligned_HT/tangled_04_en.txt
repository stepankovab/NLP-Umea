She's a girl with the best intentions
He's a man of his own invention
She looked out of the window He walked out the door
But she followed him
And he said, "What'cha lookin' for
She said I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see
Something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see

He's been livin' in a pure illusion
She's gonna come
to her own conclusion
Right when you think you know what to say
Someone comes along and shows you a brand new way

She said, "I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see
Something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything - 'cause It's so easy to make believe,
it seems you're livin' in a dream Don't you see that what you need
is standing in front of you I want something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see
Something that I want
Something that I tell myself I need
Something that I want
And I need everything I see
