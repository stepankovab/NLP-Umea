# Comparing singability of translated songs

The topic of song singability is widely discussed in the linguistic and human translation areas. It is a complex task. In machine translation we are more focused on preserving the meaning than a certain structure, as different languages differ vastly in structure.

My goal for this research project is to implement already proposed metrics, as well as come up with my own to quantify the singability of a song in a few numbers.

After implementing the metrics, I will compare performance of the original human-translated lyrics and machine-translated lyrics.

The goal is to find out how big of a performance distance is between these three methods of lyrics translation, and if there is any difference between the experiments when I switch target and source language.

## Data

Data used for the project can be found in a **DATA** folder, divided by means how they were obtained and further by language.

## Code

The codes used for evaluation of the experiments can be found in a folder **CODE**.
